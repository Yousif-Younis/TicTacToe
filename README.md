# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

A **C++ Tic Tac Toe game** that demonstrates **data structures and algorithms**.  
The project includes:
- Two-player mode
- AI opponent (Easy & Hard)
- Minimax algorithm with game tree search
- Input validation and board management

---

## ✨ Features
- **Data Structures:** 2D arrays for board representation, tree nodes for game states  
- **Algorithms:** Minimax algorithm for Hard AI, recursion for game tree exploration  
- Player vs Player mode  
- Player vs AI (Easy = random moves, Hard = minimax)  
- Win/draw detection logic  
- Console-based UI
